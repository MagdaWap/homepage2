## Description
One of my first coding projects. This one is about learning English language. I’m an English teacher now so it’s one of my interests. 

## Applied technologies
- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS
- BEM convention
- Normalize.css
- GIT

## CSS
  This folder contains 4 files : body.css , header.css, navigation.css and section.css. 
  Each of them define individual elements to create the layout of an HTML document.

## Java Script
This folder contains a script.js file. I’m starting to learn JS, so there is a simple interactive button.
When you press the button the table appears another click makes it disappears.
